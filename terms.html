<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <hr>

        <p> In the last section of this agreement, you will find definitions of some of the words and phrases used in
            these
            terms and conditions.
        </p>


        <h3>1. THE ACCOUNTS ON WHICH YOU MAY USE THE SERVICES</h3>

        <p>1.1 By agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you agree that the Service will be available on
            all
            eligible accounts with us, whether open now or opened in the future, including any joint accounts you hold
            with
            others. The Service cannot be used on some types of accounts and we will advise you from time to time as to
            which accounts are eligible.</p>

        <p>1.2 In order to use the Service, you must be :</p>

        <p>1.2.1 an account holder with Standard Chartered Bank, India and aged 18 or over; and</p>

        <p>1.2.2 registered by us to use the Service.</p>

        <h3>2. FOLLOWING OUR USER GUIDANCE</h3>

        <p>2.1 User Guidance on the operation of the Service will be made available to you. User Guidance will cover
            (among
            other things) the times when the Service is available, how to access and operate the Service, what things
            you
            can and cannot do with the Service, and the time it usually takes to carry out particular types of
            transactions.
            You must follow all relevant User Guidance whenever you access and operate the Service.</p>

        <p>2.2 We may inform you from time to time about changes to the way you should access or operate the Service.
            You
            must observe all such changes when accessing or operating the Service.</p>

        <h3>3. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SECURITY - I/we have read through & hereby confirm having requisite knowledge
            and
            experience in using online/electronic mediums of banking.</h3>

        <p>3.1 To ensure that you alone are able to access and give instructions on your accounts using the Service, you
            must adopt and at all times maintain the following security procedures.</p>

        <p>3.2 To enable you to use the Service, we will give you a user identification code and an initial password and
            you may then choose your own Password for the Service. These are your Security Codes and both will be used
            to
            identify you whenever you access the Service. If you are agreeing to the terms of this agreement jointly
            with
            others, we will give each of you a unique user identification code and an initial password and each of you
            may
            then choose your own individual Password. Both of you will be jointly and severally liable to us for all
            dues
            payable to us and/or in case of loss/ damage, whatsoever, caused/suffered to/by us due to use of any or all
            of
            the service.
        </p>
        <h4>Safeguarding your Password and Security Codes</h4>

        <p>3.3 In connection with your Security Codes:</p>

        <p>3.3.1 you should change your Password regularly and may do so if the Service requires you to do so. You
            should
            not choose a Password you have used before;:</p>

        <p>3.3.2 whenever you choose a Password, you must take care not to choose a number that is likely to be guessed
            by
            anyone trying to access the Service pretending to be you. For example, you should avoid your own or a
            relative's
            birthday or any part of your telephone number;:</p>

        <p>3.3.3 you must take all reasonable steps to ensure that you safeguard your Security Codes at all times. You
            must
            not disclose any details of your Password to anyone else, including to someone who is a joint account holder
            with you, or to a member of our staff, or to someone giving assistance on a technical helpdesk in connection
            with the Service;:</p>

        <p>3.3.4 you must not record your Security Codes in a way that could make them recognisable by someone else as
            Security Codes;:</p>

        <p>3.3.5 if you discover or suspect that your Password or any part of them are known to someone else, you must
            immediately change the Password yourself through the Service. If this is not possible, you must notify us
            immediately by telephoning us on our Phone Banking Centre Numbers (or any other number we may let you have
            from
            time to time for this purpose). We will suspend use of the Service until new Security Codes have been set
            up.
            Any transaction done prior to such a notification and done within1 working day after giving such notice,
            shall
            be entirely at your risk and cost.:</p>

        <h4>Checking your statements</h4>

        <p>3.4 If you become aware of any transaction on any of your accounts that has not been validly authorised by
            you,
            you must notify us immediately by telephoning us on our Phone Banking Centre Numbers (or any other number we
            may
            let you have from time to time for this purpose). For this purpose, you are reminded that you must, as is
            required of you for all your accounts, check all bank Statements for any unauthorised transactions.
        </p>
        <h4>Other security safeguards</h4>

        <p>3.5 You must not allow anyone else to operate the Service on your behalf.</p>

        <p>3.6 You must not leave Your System unattended while you are on-line to the Service. This applies whether Your
            System is a device you have sourced independently of us or a device provided by us to access the Service in
            one
            of our branches. However, the public nature of our branches makes it particularly important that if you
            access
            the Service from a device in one of our branches you do not leave that device unattended while on-line and
            you
            ensure that you have gone off-line before leaving the branch.</p>

        <p>3.7 You must not access the Service from any device connected to a local area network (or LAN), such as an
            office environment, without first making sure that no one else is able to observe or copy your access or
            obtain
            access to the Service pretending to be you.</p>
        <p>
            3.8 You must comply with any other requirements designed to protect the security of your use of the Service
            which are set out in the User Guidance or notified by us to you in any other way.</p>

        <p>3.9 We will not be liable in any manner whatsoever due to unauthorised usage and for all purposes any usage
            will
            be construed as a proper and authenticated usage.</p>

        <h3> 4. YOUR AUTHORITY TO US TO CARRY OUT INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

        <p>4.1 You agree that the use of the Security Codes agreed between us for the Service is adequate identification
            of
            you. We are entitled, but not obliged, to act on instructions (using the Security Codes via the Service)
            without
            obtaining any further written or other confirmation from you, even if those instructions are not actually
            given
            or authorised by you (except in the circumstances described in section 4.2).</p>

        <h4>Your liability for unauthorised instructions</h4>

        <p>4.2 You will be liable for any or all misuse of your Password by someone to give unauthorised instructions
            purporting to come from you except in case of wilful or negligent act on our part. Further it is your
            responsibility to ensure:</p>

        <p>4.2.1 that all the security procedures described in sections 3.1 to 3.3.4 inclusive and 3.5 to 3.8 inclusive
            have been faithfully observed; and</p>

        <p>4.2.2 You will be held liable for all losses due to unauthorised use if you have acted fraudulently or with
            negligence or if you are in default of any of the security obligations described in sections 3.1 to 3.3.4
            inclusive and 3.5 to 3.8 inclusive or the notification requirements of section 3.3.5.</p>
        <p>
            4.3 You will not be responsible nor have any liability for any instruction that is not authorised by you but
            is
            given using your Security Codes if:</p>

        <p>4.3.1 such instruction is given after you have notified us that you have discovered or suspect that your
            Password is known to someone else in accordance with section 3.3.5; or
        </p>
        <p>4.3.2 your Password has become known to the person giving the unauthorised instruction as a result of our
            failure to comply with clause 8.1 or any negligence or wilful default on our part.
        </p>
        <h4>Acting on your instructions</h4>

        <p>4.4 You must not use the Service to create an unauthorised overdraft on any of your accounts and we are
            entitled
            to refuse to accept any instruction that would do so. If an unauthorised overdraft is created, we may take
            any
            action we think fit and charge any interest and charges to the account in question (in accordance with the
            terms
            and conditions of that account). You agree that:
        </p>
        <p>4.4.1 it is your responsibility to make sure that no unauthorised overdrafts are created; and</p>

        <p>4.4.2 you will not rely on the operation of the Service to prevent an unauthorised overdraft being created.
            In
            particular, you must remember that your cheques and any payment instructions you have given via the Service
            might take time to clear and might not always be immediately reflected in the balance on your account.
        </p>
        <p>4.5 When we receive a transaction instruction from you through the Service, we will be entitled to debit any
            payment plus any charges payable for the transaction from the account you have specified or any other
            account
            that you hold with us. Once you have given an instruction through the Service, you will not be able to
            reverse
            it. We will be under no obligation:
        </p>
        <p>4.5.1 to reverse an instruction you have given; or
        </p>
        <p>4.5.2 to accept an instruction that is conditional or reversible or which requires us to pay a third party
            sooner than we would be able to pay them following our normal banking practices.</p>

        <p>However, if you do ask us to reverse an instruction after you have given it, we may at our discretion try to
            do
            so to the extent that this is possible under the rules and practices of the banking system. You agree that
            you
            will be responsible for any costs we incur as a result.
        </p>
        <p>4.6 You hereby confirm and acknowledge that payments through electronic transfer of funds are subject to
            Sec.40A (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>


        <p>4.7 We may, when we believe we are justified in doing so:</p>

        <p> 4.7.1 refuse to carry out an instruction given via the Service; or</p>

        <p> 4.7.2 require written confirmation from you of a particular instruction.</p>

        <p>If we come to believe that an instruction may not have been properly authorised by you, we will be entitled,
            after making reasonable efforts to check whether it was properly authorised, to take steps to reverse any
            action
            taken on the basis of that instruction. We will not be responsible for any loss to you that results from
            such a
            reversal.</p>

        <p> 4.8 When you give an instruction via the Service, we will act on that instruction in accordance with the
            cut-off
            times notified to you through the Service. From time to time we may notify you of changes to these cut-off
            times. Instructions given at any other time may not be acted on until the next Business day.
        </p>
        <p> 4.9 The bank shall endeavour to provide to you through the electronic banking service, (but will not give
            any
            commitment on its part) services such as balance enquiry, transaction details, statement of accounts, funds
            transfer, bill payments, requests for issuance of cheque book and demand drafts, stop payment instructions
            as
            well as opening of new deposit accounts and such other facilities as the bank may decide to provide form
            time to
            time. These facilities may be offered in a phased manner at the discretion of the Bank.
        </p>
        <p> 4.9.1 The Bank shall endeavour to effect fund transfer and payment transactions received through the service
            provided there are sufficient funds available in your account. The Bank will not be liable for any omission
            to
            make any of these payments or for late payments due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the
            Bank,

        </p>
        <p> 4.9.2 The Bank may choose to offer existing or added services through any of its group companies or a third
            party with whom the Bank has entered into an agreement for the same. It will be Bank's aim to protect your
            interest in all such arrangements and agreements.
        </p>
        <p> 4.9.3 For all the services, products and facilities offered through the service,

            Standard terms, conditions of the Bank and / or RBI rules apply
            All loans and deposits are at the sole discretion of the Bank
            All rates, tariffs, and charges are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Bank
        </p>
        <h3> 5. IF YOU HOLD ANY JOINT ACCOUNTS</h3>

        <p>5.1 In connection with any account which you hold jointly (provided that this may be operated on a single
            signing authority basis) with others, you agree that:
        </p>
        <p>5.1.1 any single party to a joint account may validly give instructions via the Service in connection with
            that
            joint account.</p>

        <p>5.2 The provisions of section 5.1 above override any other existing arrangements in connection with your
            authority to operate joint accounts.
        </p>
        <p>5.3 In connection with any account which you hold jointly with others and requires two or more authorised
            signatories to be operated, you and the joint signatories will only be able to utilise such part of the
            Service
            which allows you to obtain information about the account, including but not limited to the balance of the
            account.
        </p>
        <p>5.4 All of you will be jointly and severally liable to us for all dues payable to us and / or in case of loss
            /
            damage, whatsoever, caused / suffered to / by us due to use of any or all of the service.
        </p>
        <h3>6. OPERATING TIMES, CHANGES AND DISRUPTIONS</h3>

        <p>6.1 The Service will usually be available for use at the times given in the User Guidance or at other times
            notified to you. You accept, however, that routine maintenance requirements, excess demand on the systems
            and
            circumstances beyond our control may mean it is not always possible for the Service to be available during
            its
            normal operating hours.
        </p>
        <p>6.2 In connection with the Service, we are entitled at any time to:
        </p>
        <p>6.2.1 change the mode of operation; or</p>

        <p> 6.2.2 add to, remove or otherwise change, end or suspend any of the facilities available; or
        </p>
        <p> 6.2.3 end the Service.</p>

        <p>If we decide to change or end the Service, we will try to give you 30 days notice or whatever shorter period
            of
            notice may be reasonable in the circumstances. We will in no way be liable in case of such termination / end
            of
            service and / or for any loss caused / suffered in this regard.</p>
